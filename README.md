# iDAI.field Web

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* docker-compose
* A couchdb data source with data, as generated by dainst/idai-field-client

## Quickstart | API

Prepare the configuration:

    $ cd api
    $ cp config/dev_prod.exs.template config/dev.exs
    $ vi config/dev.exs # Edit

Set up a connection to a couchdb instance and configure at least one project (`projects: ["<project>"]`). 
Also make sure for the following curl commands to work withouth authentication in a quick demo,
that you give the anonymous user admin rights by setting `users: [%{ name: "anonymous", admin: true }]`. 

Start elasticsearch, cantaloupe and the api web service with docker and index all configured projects

    $ docker-compose up
    $ curl -XPOST localhost:4000/api/worker/reindex
    $ curl localhost:4000/api/documents             # See properly indexed documents via api

## Quickstart | UI

Visit the `ui` directory

    $ cd ui
    $ npm i

Prepare the configuration:

    $ cp src/configuration.json.template src/configuration.json
    $ vi src/configuration.json # Edit

Start the iDAI.field UI with `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3001`.
Start the iDAI.shapes UI with `npm run start-shapes` and visit  `http://localhost:3002`.

## Quickstart | Images

For conversion of images and tiles run

    $ curl -XPOST localhost:4000/api/worker/conversion       # if one has images from the client
    $ curl -XPOST localhost:4000/api/worker/tiling           # if there are georeferenced images
    
If you have images, place them under `data/cantaloupe` (or override the docker-compose configuration as described further below, to change the default location)

## Quickstart | Authorization

TODO set up users in dev.exs
TODO login via frontend

## Usage | API

To index a single project

    $ curl -XPOST localhost:4000/api/worker/update_mapping    # necessary at least once before reindexing any project
    $ curl -XPOST localhost:4000/api/worker/reindex/:project 

TODO describe getting a auth token via api

## Development

Note that containers can be started independently

    $ docker-compose up elasticsearch
    $ docker-compose up cantaloupe
    $ docker-compose up api

## Development | API

### Interactive Elixir

    $ docker-compose run --service-ports --entrypoint "iex -S mix" api

### Testing

    $ docker-compose run --service-ports --entrypoint "mix test test/app && mix test --no-start test/unit" api

or
 
    $ docker-compose run --entrypoint "/bin/bash" api
    $ mix test test/app                 # application/subsystem tests
    $ mix test --no-start test/unit     # unit tests

### Override docker-compose configuration to change image directories

in config.exs

In order to be able to see images you can override the images volume by creating
a `docker-compose.override.yml` that contains the volume definition. This
file gets automatically picked up by `docker-compose` and will not be published
to the repository.

docker-compose.override.yml

    version: "3.7"
    
    services:
        cantaloupe:
            volumes:
                - "/host/environment/path/to/images/project_a_name:/imageroot/project_a_name"
                - "/host/environment/path/to/images/project_b_name:/imageroot/project_b_name"
            
        api:    
            volumes:
                - "/host/environment/path/to/images/project_a_name:/imageroot/project_a_name"
                - "/host/environment/path/to/images/project_b_name:/imageroot/project_b_name"

## Development | UI

The frontend runs on port 3001. It autmatically picks the next available port if 3001 is already in use.

To build for production use:

    $ npm run build
            
## Development | Managing containers
            
### (Re-)building containers

    $ docker-compose up --build api

### Managing dependencies

In order to add a dependency it has to be added to `mix.exs`. Afterwards, the api docker container
has to be rebuilt explicitly with:

    $ docker-compose build api

After removing a dependency from `mix.exs` the following command has to be run inside api/ to make
sure `mix.lock` reflects the change:

    $ mix deps.clean --unused --unlock

Afterwards, the api docker container has to be rebuilt explicitly with:

    $ docker-compose build api
